# OpenImageIO (oiio)

Builds and installs the [OpenImageIO] library from source<sup>[1][oiio_github]</sup>.  
While there are potentially some easier methods, the cookbook follows the build instructions for OpenImageIO found [here][oiio_build_instructions].

Alternatives might include downloading releases directly and using [ark][ark_cookbook], but syncing the git repositories does automatically grab patch versions (OIIO branches are marked on minor and major patch)
